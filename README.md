Im currently studying 1ÂºDAM and web development on my own.
My goal is to be a web front-end developer.

I'll upload pieces of code in HTML, CSS and JS of things that I do and find interesting or useful enough to upload them to a public repository.

If you want to reach me, you can do it via mail: schuberg.4599@gmail.com
